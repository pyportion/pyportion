# Welcome to PyPortion Docs

PyPortion is a lightweight and developer-friendly Python CLI tool that **helps you accelerate project development**, **keep your codebase consistent**, and **eliminate repetitive work**.

## How does PyPortion work?

PyPortion works as a command-line interface (CLI) that helps you create, manage, and standardize Python projects using predefined and customizable templates.

At a high level, PyPortion follows a simple workflow:

### 1. Initialize a project

You start by running a PyPortion command from your terminal that creates a directory with a clean and well-structured layout based on the selected template.

* Does that mean existing projects won’t be covered by PyPortion?

No. You can turn any existing project into a PyPortion project, and we will discuss this later.

### 2. Apply templates

Templates define the project structure, files, and configurations. PyPortion ships with built-in templates and also allows you to create or extend your own to match your project and team standards.

### 3. Automate repetitive setup

Common setup tasks, such as creating folders, configuration files, and base modules, are handled automatically. This removes repetitive work and ensures consistency across your projects.
